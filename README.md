# Future Work
  [ ] Support batch solutions by reading data from a CSV file.
  [ ] Clarify the exact units for ambiguous items (tablespoons, cups, and gallons can vary in meaning).
  [ ] Implement tests
  [ ] Implement any missing React best-practices.
  [ ] Improve the user interface to be more appealing.
  [ ] Support continuous deployment.
